# Global Sport Finance Power BI Dashboard
![]()

Yes, I can build a dashboard. But what about insights? I don’t want to just deliver something that looks good - I want to answer what the stakeholder needs to know, even if they haven’t asked it yet.

Performed exploratory analysis and it helped me discover two key relationships:
Total Budget vs. Rank
Annual Pay vs. Rank
Using Excel’s =CORREL() formula, I found:
- As total budget increases, rank improves (i.e., lower Current Year Rank).
- Teams with higher annual pay also tend to perform better.

When I was clear about what mattered, I focused on communicating it effectively.
- I categorized total budget into: Elite, Strong, Modest, and Limited budgets. This will help stakeholders to evaluate performance by investment level.
- I also grouped teams by annual pay trends: Consistent Growth, No Growth, New Entry, Short-Term Drop, and Recent Change - making it easier to spot key patterns at a glance.
